  <span class="purple-color">Welcome</span> to my site where you will find all the mediocre things 
You might see me jumping, climbing buildings, and stopping trains. But nobody pays me a dime for that work. That's why I am learning and mastering web development. I will not stop until I become the Web Development Hero.

<h2>BIG DREAM</h2>
    <h4>Web Developer</h4>
    <p>
       Every day, I study new topics in html and css. I take what I learn and build on top of what I already know by adding to my portfolio (what you're looking at right now) or build new projects. All of my free time is dedicated to learning everything I can so maybe one day I can grow up to be the person other people say, "Wow, I bet she studied new topics in html and css everyday"

      <p>They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remote web developer. I made their website and showed it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.</p>
